     - Service Name: `FREEPDB1`
   
3. **Verify Database Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Oracle service is running (Windows)
   sc query OracleServiceFREE
   
   # Should show STATE: RUNNING
   # If not running:
   net start OracleServiceFREE
   ```

4. **Test Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Open Command Prompt and test with sqlplus
   sqlplus system/YourPassword123#@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1
   
   # If connected, you'll see: Connected to: Oracle Database 23ai Free...
   # Type 'exit' to quit sqlplus
   ```

### Step 4: Install SQL Developer (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Download SQL Developer:**
   - Visit: https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/
   - Download the Windows 64-bit with JDK included

   - Click the green "+" icon for new connection
   - Fill in:
     - Connection Name: `local_resume_db`
     - Username: `SYSTEM`
     - Password: `YourPassword123#` #Your defined password during oracledb setup
     - Save Password: ‚úì (check)
     - Hostname: `localhost`
     - Port: `1521`
     - Service name: `FREEPDB1` (select radio button)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Step 1: Verify Oracle Service is Running
```bash
# Windows Command Prompt (Run as Administrator)
net start OracleServiceFREE

# If already running, you'll see:
# "The requested service has already been started."
```

### Step 2: Setup Database Schema
```bash
# Paste and execute below query in SQL Developer worksheet:
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    candidate_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
        START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR2(200 BYTE),
    address VARCHAR2(500 BYTE),
    career_objective CLOB,
    skills CLOB,
    educational_institution_name CLOB,
    degree_names CLOB,
    passing_years CLOB,
    educational_results CLOB,
    result_types CLOB,
    major_field_of_studies CLOB,
    professional_company_names CLOB,
    company_urls CLOB,
    start_dates CLOB,
    end_dates CLOB,
    yoe NUMBER,
    related_skills_in_job CLOB,
    positions CLOB,
    locations CLOB,
    responsibilities CLOB,
